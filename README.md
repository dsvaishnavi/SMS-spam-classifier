📧 Email Spam Detection using TF-IDF & Multinomial Naive Bayes

  This project is a machine learning–based Spam Email Classifier built using:
  
  TF-IDF Vectorization for text feature extraction
  
  Multinomial Naive Bayes as the classification algorithm
  
  Achieved ~97–99% accuracy depending on dataset and preprocessing
  
  The model predicts whether an email is spam or ham (not spam).

🔍 Project Overview

  Email spam detection is one of the core NLP (Natural Language Processing) applications.
  In this project:
  
  The email text is cleaned (removing punctuation, stopwords, symbols).
  
  TF-IDF converts text into numerical feature vectors.
  
  Multinomial Naive Bayes is trained on these features.
  
  The model predicts new emails as spam or ham.
  
  This approach is fast, lightweight, and performs extremely well for text classification.
